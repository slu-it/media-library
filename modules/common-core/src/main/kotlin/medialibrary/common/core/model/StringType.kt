/**
 * [ValueType] for [String] values.
 *
 * Since a _string_ could be basically anything it is highly recommended to
 * define custom requirements to further limit what kinds of values are actually
 * valid.
 *
 * In order to provide a minimum safety net the default requirements are
 * [isNotBlank] and [hasMaxLength]. Making sure that a [StringType] has to have
 * content which is limited with a reasonable default max length.
 *
 * [StringType] also implements [Comparable] based on the natural order of [String].
